      <h2 style="color: #006400; text-align: center">The Sport</h2>
      <p>
        Cross country is a sport where teams and individuals run races over
        natural terrain (dirt or grass). This includes forests, fields, or
        pretty big hills. The courses can be challenging, usually with slanted
        surfaces, and steep inclines.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #006400; text-align: center">Nutrition & Diet</h2>
      <p>
        The diet of a cross country runner is very important for performance and
        recovery. It is a balance of macronutrients such as carbs, fats, and
        protein.
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.6; color: #2e4347">
        <li>
          Carbohydrates are the main fuel source. Runners should focus on things
          like whole grains, oats, and rice to maintain energy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protein is essential for muscle repair and recovery. It include meats,
          beans, and (healthy) yogurt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fats are important for long-term energy. Avocados, nuts, and olive oil
          are good examples of healthy fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hydration is needed. Water is very important (gatorade is not).
          Runners must consistently drink water throughout the day everyday.
          This prevents dehydration while running. Gatorade is not good because
          it contains too much sugar, and is generally unhealthy. Water is a
          much better and natural form of hydration for runners.
